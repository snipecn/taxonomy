        Red Hat Update Infrastructure 4 (RHUI 4) is a highly scalable, highly redundant
        framework that enables you to manage repositories and content. It also enables cloud providers to
        deliver content and updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instances. Based on the upstream Pulp
        project, RHUI allows cloud providers to locally mirror Red Hat-hosted repository content, create custom
        repositories with their own content, and make those repositories available to a large group of end users
        through a load-balanced content delivery system.

        As a system administrator, you can prepare your infrastructure for participation in the Red Hat Certified
        Cloud and Service Provider program by installing and configuring the Red Hat Update Appliance
        (RHUA), content delivery servers (CDS), repositories, shared storage, and load balancing.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            what components included in RHUI?
        answer: |
            RHUI components includes RHUA, CDS and load balancing.
      - question: |
            what is full name of RHUA?
        answer: |
            the RHUA full name is Red Hat Update Appliance.
      - question: |
            what is full name of CDS?
        answer: |
            the CDS full name is Content Delivery Servers
  - context: |
        There is one RHUA per RHUI installation, though in many cloud environments there will be one RHUI
        installation per region or data center, for example, Amazonâ€™s EC2 cloud comprises several regions. In
        every region, there is a separate RHUI set up with its own RHUA node.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            how many RHUA is installed in one RHUI environment?
        answer: |
            In one RHUI environment, only 1 RHUA node allow to be installed.
      - question: |
            how many RHUI will be setup in many cloud environments?
        answer: |
            the RHUI can be setup per region or data center.
      - question: |
            how Amazon's EC2 cloud distribute the RHUI?
        answer: |
            Amazon's EC2 cloud distribute the RHUI in every region
  - context: |
        The CDS nodes provide the repositories that clients connect to for the updated content. There can be
        as few as one CDS. Because RHUI provides a load-balancer with failover capabilities, we recommended
        that you use multiple CDS nodes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            what is the usage about CDS nodes?
        answer: |
            The CDS nodes provide the repositories that clients connect to for the updated content.
      - question: |
            how many CDS need to be setup at least?
        answer: |
            There can be as few as one CDS per RHUI environment.
      - question: |
            how many CDS is setup for recommendation?
        answer: |
            we recommended that you use multiple CDS nodes.
  - context: |
        The CDS nodes host content to end-user RHEL systems. While there is no required number of systems,
        the CDS works in a round-robin style load-balanced fashion (A, B, C, A, B, C) to deliver content to end-
        user systems. The CDS uses HTTP to host content to end-user systems via yum repositories.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            how to work about CDS?
        answer: |
            The CDS nodes host content to end-user RHEL systems.
      - question: |
            how CDS delivery the content to enduser?
        answer: |
            the CDS works in a round-robin style load-balanced fashion (A, B, C, A, B, C) to deliver content to enduser systems.
      - question: |
            what the protocol use by CDS?
        answer: |
            The CDS uses HTTP to host content to end-user systems via yum repositories.
